**User Registration and Calculator**
This is a simple web application that allows users to register using their email, user name and password, and then perform basic mathematical operations using a calculator.

**Prerequisites**
To use this application, you need a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Edge. You also need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser.

**Getting started**
To get started, open the index.html file in your web browser. This will take you to the user registration page, which has three input fields: Email, User Name, and Password.

**Input field validation**
All three input fields are validated to ensure that they are not empty and that they meet certain criteria.

**Email:** Only northeastern email ids are accepted. If the email is invalid or does not match the required format, an error message is displayed.
**User Name:** It must not contain any special characters and should be at least 3 characters long. If the user name is invalid, an error message is displayed.
**Password:** It must be at least 6 characters long and must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number. If the password is invalid, an error message is displayed.
**Registration:**If all input fields are valid, the user can click the "Register" button to submit the form. If the registration is successful, the user is redirected to the calculator page.

**Calculator**
The calculator page has two input fields and four buttons: "Add", "Subtract", "Multiply" and "Divide". The user can enter two numbers in the input fields and click on one of the buttons to perform the corresponding operation.

**Input field validation**
Both input fields are validated to ensure that they only contain numbers. If either input field is invalid, an error message is displayed.

**Mathematical operations**
All four mathematical operations are performed using a single arrow function. The result is then displayed in a read-only label/text field.
